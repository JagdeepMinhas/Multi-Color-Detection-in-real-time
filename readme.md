# Multi-Color Detection in Real-Time using OpenCV

This project is a Python-based application that uses OpenCV to detect multiple colors (such as red, green, and blue) in real-time through a webcam. The program identifies the contours of the detected colors and draws bounding rectangles around them, along with labels indicating the color.


## Introduction

The objective of this project is to detect specific colors in a video stream from a webcam. By converting the image to the HSV color space, the program can efficiently identify and track objects based on their color. This project can be useful for various applications, including object tracking, computer vision experiments, and more.

## Features

- Real-time color detection (red, green, blue)
- Contour detection and bounding box creation around detected colors
- Labeling of detected colors directly on the video stream

## Installation
